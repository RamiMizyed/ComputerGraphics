in the begining of the code we have 2 variables 
resX = 300 	--> accounts for the resolution of our render, set to 300 during testing to speed up the process.
resY = 300


Most chalenging part was the triangle intersect  and the matrix operations in the squashed portion , it was the most hard trying to debug ("i still couldnt fix it after 1 1/2 weeks of work")
and is the reason for my late submission.
all outcomes were perfectly correct, only the triangle sphere intersect kept coming wrong.

# other Changes:
i deleted my old vector3 script and changed it to one i found online from cgkit.
i added progress bars to the rendering process.
my code is not very optimized and it somehwhat runs slowly, im planning to improve it more maybe add some parallelization.
